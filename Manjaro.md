# My setup for Manjaro 

(Desktop, you are pretty cooked if you run it on a server tbh) 

Might need to change a few things in the i3 dotfiles if you are on x86/amd64 software

## i3 and friends

  sudo pacman -S i3 i3blocks i3status dmenu picom nitrogen volumeicon vim zsh htop git i3exit

## Important other things you need to do

Put in that file for the trackball

Enable uuuuuuhhhh panfrost
